# go-crypto-openssl

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/microsoft/go-crypto-openssl/openssl.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/microsoft/go-crypto-openssl/openssl)

The `openssl` package implements Go crypto primitives using OpenSSL shared libraries and cgo. When configured correctly, OpenSSL can be executed in FIPS mode, making the `openssl` package FIPS compliant.

The `openssl` package is designed to be used as a drop-in replacement for the [boring](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/internal/boring) package in order to facilitate integrating `openssl` inside a forked Go toolchain.

## Disclaimer

A program directly or indirectly using this package in FIPS mode can claim it is using a FIPS-certified cryptographic module (OpenSSL), but it can't claim the program as a whole is FIPS certified without passing the certification process, nor claim it is FIPS compliant without ensuring all crypto APIs and workflows are implemented in a FIPS-compliant manner.

## Background

FIPS 140-2 is a U.S. government computer security standard used to approve cryptographic modules. FIPS compliance may come up when working with U.S. government and other regulated industries.

### Go FIPS compliance

The Go `crypto` package is not FIPS certified, and the Go team has stated that it won't be, e.g. in [golang/go/issues/21734](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21734#issuecomment-326980213) Adam Langley says:

> The status of FIPS 140 for Go itself remains "no plans, basically zero chance".

On the other hand, Google maintains a branch that uses cgo and BoringSSL to implement various crypto primitives: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/dev.boringcrypto/README.boringcrypto.md. As BoringSSL is FIPS 140-2 certified, an application using that branch is more likely to be FIPS 140-2 compliant, yet Google does not provide any liability about the suitability of this code in relation to the FIPS 140-2 standard.

## Features

### Multiple OpenSSL versions supported

OpenSSL does not maintain ABI compatibility between different releases, even if only the last digit is increased. The `openssl` package has support for multiple OpenSSL versions, yet each version has a different amount of automated validation:

- OpenSSL 1.1.1: the Microsoft CI builds official releases and runs automated tests with this version.
- OpenSSL 1.0.1: the Microsoft CI builds official releases, but doesn't run tests, so it may not produce working applications.
- OpenSSL 1.1.0 and 3.0: the Microsoft CI does not build nor test these versions, so they may or may not work.

Versions not listed above are not supported at all.

### Dynamic OpenSSL loading

The OpenSSL shared library `libcrypto` is loaded at runtime using [dlopen](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlopen.3.html) when calling `openssl.Init`. Therefore, dlopen's shared library search conventions also apply here.

The `libcrypto` shared library file name varies among different platforms, so a best effort is done to find and load the right file:

- The base name is always `libcrypto.so`.
- Well-known version strings are appended to the base name, until the file is found, in the following order: `3` -> `1.1` -> `11` -> `111` -> `1.0.2` -> `1.0.0`.

This algorithm can be overridden by setting the environment variable `GO_OPENSSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE` to the desired version string. For example, `GO_OPENSSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE="1.1.1k-fips"` makes the runtime look for the shared library `libcrypto.so.1.1.1k-fips` before running the checks for well-known versions.

### Portable OpenSSL

The OpenSSL bindings are implemented in such a way that the OpenSSL version used when building a program does not have to match with the OpenSSL version used when running it.

This feature does not require any additional configuration, but it only works with OpenSSL versions known and supported by the Go toolchain.

## Limitations

OpenSSL is used for a given build only in limited circumstances:

- The platform must be GOOS=linux.
- The build must have cgo enabled.
- The android build tag must not be specified.

## Acknowledgements

The work done to support FIPS compatibility mode leverages code and ideas from other open-source projects:

- All crypto stubs are a mirror of Google's [dev.boringcrypto branch](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/dev.boringcrypto) and the release branch ports of that branch.
- The mapping between BoringSSL and OpenSSL APIs is taken from Fedora's [Go fork](https://pagure.io/go).
- The portable OpenSSL implementation is ported from Microsoft's [.NET runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) cryptography module.
